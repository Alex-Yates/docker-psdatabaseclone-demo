# Introduction 
This repo holds the demo code for my "Containers vs Clones: Database provisioning made simple" session with [Andrew Pruski](https://gist.github.com/dbafromthecold).

Requires:
- [Docker for Windows](https://www.docker.com/)
- Source SQL Server database
- The latest [SQL Server on Linux docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-mssql-server)
- Visual Studio Database Projects and SSDT
- [SQLPackage.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/sqlpackage?view=sql-server-2017)

# Acknowledgements
It builds on Andrew's [excellent work with containers](https://dbafromthecold.com/2017/03/15/summary-of-my-container-series/), and [a simple PS script he wrote](https://gist.github.com/dbafromthecold/9456b5f968b1c1f497109cada6d1a3ea), and puts it into the context of an example database source control project.

Also, credit must be paid to [Sander Stad](https://github.com/sanderstad), the creator of [PsDatabaseClone](https://psdatabaseclone.org/), the tool that makes all this magic possible.
